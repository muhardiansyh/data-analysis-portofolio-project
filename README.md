## Muhammad Ardiansyah | Bridging Management, Finance, and Data-Driven Solutions

Welcome to my portfolio repository. This space showcases my capability in transforming raw business data into actionable insights using advanced spreadsheet modeling, data visualization, and foundational data science concepts.

My projects focus on demonstrating proficiency in:

- Advanced Spreadsheet Modeling (Microsoft Excel/Google Sheets)

- Customer Analytics (RFM)

- Data Validation & Feature Engineering

- Interactive Dashboarding

# About My Approach
My methodology emphasizes creating robust and auditable analytical solutions:

- Integrity: Always maintaining the original, raw data source separate from calculation sheets.

- Efficiency: Utilizing advanced functions (VLOOKUP, INDIRECT, IF logic) to automate complex data aggregation and analysis.

- Actionability: Ensuring every visualization and finding is tied directly to a clear business recommendation (e.g., Target Champions, Retain At-Risk Customers).

Feel free to dive into any of the project folders above to review the detailed methodology (README.md per proyek) and the final output files (.xlsx).
